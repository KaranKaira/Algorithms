Most basic and important algos of graphs for competitive coding

Breadth First Search (BFS)
Depth First Search (DFS)
Shortest Path from source to all vertices **Dijkstra**
Shortest Path from every vertex to every other vertex **Floyd Warshall**
Minimum Spanning tree **Prim**
Minimum Spanning tree **Kruskal**
Topological Sort
Articulation Points (or Cut Vertices) in a Graph
Bridges in a graph
Kosaraju for SCC
LCA using segment tree
Johnson Algo "find shortest paths between every pair of vertices in a given weighted directed Graph and weights may be negative"
